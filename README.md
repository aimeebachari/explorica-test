## Explorica Test

There are three files corresponding to the three challenges presented by Explorica. All console programs are written in Ruby.

### Explorica.rb

This file will print the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print Explorica instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Tours. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print ExploricaTours.

### Patterns.rb

Run this file to see some beautiful patterns created with Ruby loops.

### Strings.rb

This program requires input from a separate file that contains a number and an undisclosed number of strings. The solution will take the number and find out the minimum and maximum length of a strings correlating to the number provided.
